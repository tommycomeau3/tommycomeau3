### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tommy, I am student at San Diego State University majoring in Computer Science and am working to become a Full Stack Engineer. I'm looking to build a career in software development and gain experience in programming. I'm currently working on building responsive and user-friendly web applications, but would like to improve my skills in languages like Java and C++ in the near future.
